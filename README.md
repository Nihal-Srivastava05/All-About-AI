# All-About-AI
This repository contains a lot of algorithms, games and other codes related to AI. This repo has subfolders for each topic:
- Agents
- Search
- Adversarial Search
- Bayesian Networks

In each folder you can find a .ipynb file which has the entire code for that topic and few will also have a .py which is a GUI based simulation for the same topic. Example I have a tic tac toe agent then .ipynb file will have the agent logic and the .py file will have a actual implemented game. For the simulations I have used libraries like pygame, ursina, etc which you might need to install to run those specific files.

PRs are much appreciated and if you feel there is a problem please open an issue.
